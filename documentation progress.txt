currently trying to add a brief description to each file within the top
docstring in addition to the function documentation

it should be noted there are a number of functions with incomplete
documentation which should not be mistaken for completed (variables without
descriptions, etc)

Files yet to be confirmed as fully documented:
(though many are partly documented at this point)

scripts/
    __init__.py
    analysis.py
    context.py
    export_atf.py
    export.py
    formatting.py
    import_corpus.py
    names.py
    overfit_check.py
    professions.py
    readnames.py
    spelling.py
    utilities.py
    
tests/
    test_namesfromrule.py
