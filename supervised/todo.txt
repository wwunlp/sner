allow config file to define certain properties, which would reduce user input when invoking software
config handler should prompt for any missing fields rather than making the functions do it
that way you can throw your input in smoothly without waiting for operations to finish and then the program can just run at full speed as soon as it has what it needs from you

maybe have the config handler actually prompt the user for input so that it can then add to the 'configfile' dictionary just as the config file would

add better error handling for the initialization function




generate contextual rules

generate spelling rules


tidy up the k-gram generator in the spelling rules code

make a non shite way to produce output
