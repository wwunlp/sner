The project is organized into `classes`, `models`, `scripts`, and `tests`.
Class files should probably go into `classes`. The main file for a model
should go into `models`. General scripts should go into `scripts`, and
scripts for models should into a subdirectory of the model in `scripts`.
Test files should go into `tests`.
